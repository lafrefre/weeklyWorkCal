Non-Functional Calendar Application
Welcome to the Non-Functional Calendar Application! Please note that this is a simple calendar application intended for demonstration and educational purposes, and it is not fully functional. The application has been created to showcase the structure and basic functionality of a calendar, but some key features are not implemented.

Overview
This calendar application is designed to simulate a basic calendar experience for a typical working day, running from 9 am to 5 pm. It runs in your browser and utilizes jQuery to dynamically update the HTML and CSS elements, giving you an idea of how a functional calendar could be developed.

Features
Hourly Event Scheduling: You can see time slots for each hour from 9 am to 5 pm, and you can theoretically save events for each hour.
Dynamic Updates: The application demonstrates how the HTML and CSS can be updated dynamically to reflect events and the current time.
Stylish Design: While not fully polished, the application showcases a simple and clean design using CSS for a better user experience.
How to Use
To interact with this Non-Functional Calendar Application, follow these steps:

Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

You will see time slots from 9 am to 5 pm.

To schedule an event, theoretically, you should be able to click on an hour slot and input the event details.

The application is supposed to dynamically update the display to show your scheduled events.

The current time should be highlighted, providing you with a visual reference.

Unfortunately, due to this being a non-functional example, the event scheduling feature is not operational.

Known Issues
Since this is a non-functional example, there are some key features and issues you should be aware of:

Event Scheduling: The ability to save events is not implemented, and no actual data is being saved or stored.

Data Persistence: Events will not persist between page refreshes. Once you refresh the page, all events will be lost.

Limited Functionality: The application is purely for demonstration purposes, and it does not serve any practical calendar function.

Future Improvements
This non-functional calendar application can serve as a starting point for a functional calendar. Some future improvements could include:

Implementing event scheduling and data persistence.
Adding the ability to edit and delete scheduled events.
Introducing reminders and notifications.
Making it responsive for various screen sizes and devices.
Enhancing the user interface and user experience.
Please keep in mind that this is a basic and non-functional demonstration, and it should be used as a reference for educational purposes or as a foundation for developing a fully functional calendar application.
